# 🎮 Connect Four – Python & Pygame

Connect Four is a classic 2-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a 6×7 grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
